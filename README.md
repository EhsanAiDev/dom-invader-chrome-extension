### ⚙️ What is DOM Invader?

**DOM Invader** is a powerful tool used to detect and exploit DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.  
It helps visualize data flows in the browser and is extremely useful in modern web application testing.

Normally, DOM Invader is bundled with Burp Suite and cannot be directly used in Chrome as a standalone extension —  
**until now**.

### 🔥 Why This Repository?

This repo exists because:

- DOM Invader is incredibly helpful but **not easily accessible** outside Burp.
- Many new hackers and bug bounty hunters **struggle to extract and use it**.
- I believe **hacking is an art** and tools should be **open, hackable, and learnable**.
- Sharing this helps the **next generation** of hackers **grow faster**.

> “A hacker is someone who loves to explore and learn. Not someone limited by artificial barriers.”

### 🧠 Who Should Use This?

- Bug bounty beginners who want fast feedback from DOM-based testing.
- Hackers who want to use DOM Invader directly in Chrome DevTools.
- Researchers creating workflows outside of Burp Suite.
